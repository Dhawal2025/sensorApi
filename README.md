### Smart India Hackathon 2019 - Hardware edition

WON **First Prize** in SIH 2019 for solving the problem of the **Tracking
board for unsafe acts** for the company **Kokuyo Camlin** organized by IIT Hyderabad.

We have to make a web-based dashboard which can display the different operating factors of a factory like temperature, humidity, vibrations, machine temperature and pressure etc. in real-time.

We have implemented the WebSocket communication for instant transfer of data from the
sensor modules to the node.js server using ESP32 WiFi-enabled microcontroller boards.

Picture of how our 3D printed boxes looks like after setting up of hardware modules and PCB inside them.
